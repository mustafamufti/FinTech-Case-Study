PureFacts uses three core competencies to offer solutions to its clients and stay competitive. By Using AI and Machine Learning, where a team of PhDs with wealth management knowledge who solve complex business problems with machine learning. Data aggregation is integrated with most wealth and asset management systems including portfolio management systems, book of records, CRM systems, and any other operational or investor facing systems within the firm. Lastly, handling complex calculations to calculate fee options or crushing large data for insights for more informed decisions.

PureFacts implements Machine Learning and AI to work together with human intelligence. PureFacts retention model helps to analyze patterns for clients at risk of leaving and flags them. Advisors can use this date to retain valuable clients. Using a predictive method wealth first can determine the long-term relationship and better manage the client’s lifecycle.  Detecting data anomalies by enabling wealth firms and their advisor to proactively identify errors and prevent costly mistakes. Advisors have the ability to talk with their data to make critical insights which are powered by AutoQL. The idea behind OOTB  is pulling data from different sources and combining them into two to three steps and deploying the out of the box value predictions and integrating repeated predictions. 

##### Aggregating Data with OOTB Accelerators 
Taking data from CRM systems like Salesforce to manage their own client base. Therefore, whatever tools advisors are using we PureFacts help them manage their clients. Using custodians where the official kind of source; the main book of records where the source of truth of where that account actually lives at the end of the day. Portfolio management systems or some wealth firms and advisors, that use a system to manage their clients portfolio. These advisors are able to do complex trading and combine general market data to make any complex trade.  

They do this by using the adapter method, just like any adapter for instance USB-C to HDMI adapter. If you have a MacBook and since there isn't an HDMI port, you can use the adapter to use an HDMI cable. Same concept, PureFacts, integrates with multiple systems, it has if they hold all the pieces in the middle and combine them all together and output it from one source.  Data mapping is making sure the system matches the data directly to where it needs to be, for example matching the first name coming from the CRM system will map directly to the first name of PureFacts system. PurFacts uses data enrichment to enrich data, for example taking individual data for multiple stocks and enriching and consolidating that data a view to customers of their holding in their portfolios. 

##### Deploying OOTB Value Proven Predictions

The second layer is by taking enriched and map data to deploy predictions for clients. Like investor retention prediction, a system for PureFacts clients to retain customers based on their rating percentage. For example if a client is 60% likely to leave. PureFacts solution can tell advisors of this information and give the opportunity to convince the client that everything is okay and to discuss any changes that may need to be made to their portfolio. Moreover, a customer value prediction that tells advisors how much assets’ their customers portfolio will increase with taking out outside factors and forecasting assets for and the possible contribution to the AUM to increase year over year.  This gives the advisors the ability to see how much each client’s value is and make sure to retain those high value clients.

Using data anomaly to detect any finding that looks like an outlier from the data. Therefore, if anything seems to look the system will detect that and inform the system of the issue being ‘okay’ or ‘not okay’. Any recurring issues that arise, the solution will know what to bypass or ask for permission and learn as it goes. Using various AI models, it all boils down to statistics and numbers that look at past trends and correlations to make the best model for each client.

#### Recommendations

As competition in the wealth management industry is getting heated, as many firms are focusing on growing by acquiring new clients, increasing the share from existing clients or enlarging Salesforce. These growth strategies surround them in servicing holistic needs by bettering the client experience at each interaction through the relationship cycle, specifically focusing on the initial interaction. Client onboarding in the simplest way is the process of bringing on a new client to your business. If done right can ensure a more deeper and profitable relation with clients.

The desire for growth and the digital revolution has led wealth management fires to focus their entail investment on client onboarding. An opportunity arises to increase operational efficiency by streamlining administrative tasks and a paperless environment. Furthermore, due to recent regulatory demands firms need to be more proactive on knowing their clients and laying down the groundwork for tailored client relationships. I would suggest PureFacts to expand into an onboarding solution for its clients.

PureFacts can benefit from adding this solution as this can help to lay out the groundwork for the firm and to keep a long-term relationship with clients. It will improve the cost-to-income ratio by transforming the onboarding process from a cost center to a source of revenue, improving efficiency by scaling up and using analytic insights to amplify collaboration throughout departments. Unlocking a unique client opportunity by creating a tangible and frictionless touchpoint with clients to build customer loyalty and retention. This will optimize existing business and an opportunity for cross-selling other solutions. 

Using AI and Machine Learning and robotic process automation can make the process as quickly as possible. Ideally having a solution that can oversee client onboarding for the entire organization as quickly and seamlessly as possible. The more automation the better as automation increases speed and efficiency. Automation processes reduce the chances for errors and limit and security risks, which draws back to compliance.
